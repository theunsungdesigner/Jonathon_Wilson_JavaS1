# Katas

We use small code katas to provide the learners with individual practice of the skills taught in the lesson.

One of the most important things that we want to get through to the learners at this point is the idea of writing clean code. As they work on these katas and you review them, make sure that they are doing so.

Using proper naming conventions is also a must.

## Requirements
Some, or all, of the following skills should be demonstrable by the katas:

* Using strings
* Using ints
* Using booleans
* Using variables
* Using math on numbers
* Comparing two or more values
* Using the Scanner to get values from the user
* Printing results
* Using comments in the code to indicate what the printed results should be

## List of Katas
1. Average 3: Find the average of 3 numbers inputted by the user.
1. Multiply 3: Multiply 3 numbers inputted by the user.
1. Add 5: Add 5 numbers inputted by the user.
1. Subtract 2: Subtract the second number from the first number inputted by the user.
1. Add 13: Add 13 to the value inputted by the user and print the result to the screen.
1. Add 5 and double: Add 5 to the number inputted by the user and then double it. Print the result to the screen.
1. Double it and add 5: Double the number inputted by the user and then add 5. Print the result to the screen.
