# Loan Calculator

## Structure

- Complete the below requirements in the `LoanCalculator` project found in the `starter-code` directory.
- All code must be contained within the `main` method of the `LoanCalculator` class.
- The requirements must be implemented in the order found below.
- Once your code has been written, it can be tested using `LoanCalculatorTest`. 

## Requirements

Write a Java program that calculates and displays the mortgage payment amount given the following:

- The amount of the mortgage
- The term of the mortgage
- The annual interest rate of the mortgage

For the formula to calculate the payment, use the first formula [found here](https://www.mtgprofessor.com/formulas.htm).

## Hints

* Remember to divide the annual interest rate by 100. For example, if the annual interest rate is 12%, you must use .12 in your calculation.
* The monthly interest rate is equal to the annual interest rate divided by 12.
