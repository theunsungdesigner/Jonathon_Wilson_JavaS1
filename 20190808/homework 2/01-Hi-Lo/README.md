# Hi-Lo
The purpose of this assessment is to create a program that is a number guessing game.

## Structure

- Complete the below requirements in the `HiLo` project found in the `starter-code` directory.
- All code must be contained within the `main` method of the `HiLo` class.
- The requirements must be implemented in the order found below.
- Once your code has been written, it can be tested using `HiLoTest`. 

## Requirements

1.	The program displays a message that says, “Welcome to Hi-Low!”
1.	The program prompts for the user’s name.
1.	The program displays a message that says, “OK, <name of user>, here are the rules:”
1.	Code the game to follow these rules:
    1.	The computer will come up with a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    1.	The user will be prompted to guess the number.
    1.	If the user guesses the number correctly, the program displays:
        1.	“Congratulations, [name of user]! You win!”
        1. "It took you [number of guesses] guesses to find my number!"
    1. If the user does not guess the number correctly, the program will display “Too low!” if the guess is too low and “Too high!” if the guess is too high, and then will prompt the user for another guess.  This goes on until the number is guessed correctly.
