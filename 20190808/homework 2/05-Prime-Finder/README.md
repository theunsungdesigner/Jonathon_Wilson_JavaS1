# Prime Finder

## Structure

- Complete the below requirements in the `PrimeFinder` project found in the `starter-code` directory.
- All code must be contained within the `main` method of the `PrimeFinder` class.
- The requirements must be implemented in the order found below.
- Once your code has been written, it can be tested using `PrimeFinderTest`.

## Requirements

Write a program that takes a user input as a ceiling (inclusive) and prints all the prime numbers from 1 to the user input.

## Hints

* A prime number is a number that has no factors except for 1 and the number itself.
* Even numbers, by definition, cannot be prime.
* You can use the modulus operator (%) to check to see if one number divides evenly into another number. The modulus operator calculates the remainder of dividing one number into another. If the remainder is 0, the second number divides evenly into the first, meaning that it is a factor of that number.
  * Examples:
    * 6%2 = 0 (2 goes into 6 three times with no remainder)
    * 5%3 = 2 (3 goes into 5 one time with a remainder of 2)
* One way to check to see if a number is prime is to check to see if any of the number less than that number (excluding 1) divide evenly into it. A for loop can be used for this.
  * For example, if we want to see if 5 is prime, we would check to see if:
    * 5%2 == 0 // false, 2 goes into 5 twice with a remainder of 1
    * 5%3 == 0 // false, 3 goes into 5 once with a remainder of 2
    * 5%4 == 0 // false, 4 goes into 5 once with a remainder of 1
    * Since none of these numbers (2, 3, 4) divide evenly into 5, then 5 is a prime number.
  * For example, if we want to see if 4 is prime, we would check to see if:
    * 4%2 == 0 // true, 2 goes into 4 twice with a remainder of 0
    * 4%3 == 0 // false 3 goes into 4 once with a remainder of 1
    * Since 2 goes into 4 evenly, 4 is not prime
* Start by writing a program that just tells you whether one given number is prime. Then modify your program to meet the requirement to print all the prime numbers from 1 to the user input.
