# Rectangular Paving Company

## Structure

- Complete the below requirements in the `RectPavingCompany` project found in the `starter-code` directory.
- All code must be contained within the `main` method of the `RectPavingCompany` class.
- The requirements must be implemented in the order found below.
- Once your code has been written, it can be tested using `RectPavingCompanyTest`.

## Requirements
The purpose of the program is to calculate the total cost to pave a driveway.  Here are the requirements:

1. It must prompt the user for the width of the driveway as an integer (in feet).
1. It must prompt the user for the length of the driveway as an integer (in feet).
1. It must calculate and display the area of the driveway.
1. It must calculate and display the perimeter of the driveway.
1. Based on the area and perimeter, it must calculate the total cost of the driveway:
    - The cement for the driveway cost $12.50/square foot.
    - The framing/footers for the driveway cost $8.25/linear foot.
    - The program must calculate and display the subtotal cost of the cement.
    - The program must calculate and display the subtotal cost of the framing/footers.
    
### Version 2
Modify the program so that it does the following:

1. Prompts the user for the cost of cement
1. Prompts the user for the cost of the framing/footers
1. Calculates and displays the subtotal cost of the cement and framing/footers as in previous version.

These modifications should be added to the code created in Version 1. Do not create a new project for Version 2.
